# Rt-App-artwork-page-Canvas
I created this code for a part of app development for futureCoderSE, this app was designed for a company name Restoration trust.


As a part of futureCoderSE, I was asked to create an artwork pages with some functions to make it more interactive. The functions I was expected to create were: hotspots on the images, zoom in and out of the images, users could see the different view of the image by clicking on an arrow key, but the arrow key can only appear when hovered over it and finally users must be able to pan around the image. One of the key user requirements was the hotspot on the images must stay at the same spot no matter how many times user zooms in and drags the image, to solve this I used my mathematical problem solving skills to achieve this I multiplied the positioning of hotspots each time when the user zooms in on the image also changing the position of the hotspot. I have also created the hotspots in an array format so itâ€™s easier to add more hotpots if required, I originally thought about creating the hotspot using area and coordinates in HTML, however this wouldn't work as the size of image will be constantly changing on different devices. For the arrow keys, I similarly designed it like the hotspots so whenever a user hover over the right side of the image the arrow appears and depending on which side of the arrow the user clicks left or right the user will get the view from that specific side, so for e.g. if the user clicks the right arrow the view will change to the right side of the image.
